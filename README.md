# AGArduinoEsp32RxTx
Aqua Guard setup for arduino esp32rxtx

Windows 11 Home
Installed this driver for the ESP32: https://www.silabs.com/software-and-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads use the VCP one 

Was most likely an issue with using a USB Hub on Mac so maybe try two different usb c to a converters
